    The village of Innsburg has been terrorised by strange, other-worldly creatures for months now. Unable to endure 
    any longer, the villagers pooled their wealth and hired the most skilled adventurer they could find: you. After
    listening to their tale of woe, you agree to enter the catacombs where most of the creatures seem to originate,
    and destroy the foul beasts. Armed with a longsword and a bundle of torches, you descend into the catacombs, 
    where only madness awaits...
